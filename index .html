        <p>Today I will tell you about my Books.A book can also be a text in a larger collection of texts. That way a book is perhaps written by one author, or it only treats one subject area. ... Books can be borrowed from a library or bought from a bookstore. People can make their own books and fill them with family photos, drawings, or their own writing.e.x CHOCLATE FACTORY,STUART LITTLE.
